# My-Interactive-Stock-Price-Visualization
This project fetches stock price data for specified tickers over different time periods (5 years, 3 years, 1 year, 6 months, and 1 month) and visualizes the closing prices over these periods. The visualization is interactive, allowing the user to select the ticker and the time period using buttons.
